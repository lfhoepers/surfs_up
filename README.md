# Module 9 Challenge

## Overview of the Surfs Up

The purpose of this project is to review weather patterns in Hawaii to open a surf and ice cream shop. We focused on the weather temperature in June and December, analyzing different statistics between the two periods to come to a conclusion on whether or not it is a good idea to open a surf and ice cream shop.

The following file is the query used:

The Database used is SQLite and we can download the file [here](https://github.com/lfhoepers/surfs_up/blob/2ece03448ce1529fbe39c6d2c9fb579559a12f2c/hawaii.sqlite)


## Results:

The following image is the June Data:

The following image is the December Data:

- The average recorded temperature in June is 75F, around 4 degrees higher than the average temp in December.

- The both months have similar max temps June 85F and December 83F.

- December has lower min temperature than June diference around 8F.



## Summary: 

I would summarize that according to the images generated using matplotlib the average temperature of December with the highest frequency recorded is around 72 degrees, while June recorded different temperatures more frequently. That is, perhaps the ideal is to open in December to have more frequency initially.

I also did a precipitation analysis and after comparing June and December I noticed that despite December having a higher average of precipitation, there is not a very important difference and the two months have an average lower than 22% which makes the environment good for visit and consequently for the business.
